Generalizations:

Recall that $\bar K^m$ is the (fluid-scaled) total service entry process of the queueing system with index $m$.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem_Ktight}
The sequence $\{\bar K^m\}_{m\in\N}$ is tight in $\D$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We verify the Kurtz criteria of Proposition \ref{Kurtz} for $\{\bar K^m\}_{m\in\N}$. The first condition K1 follows from the inequalities $\bar K^m(t)\leq \bar Q^m(0)+\sum_{\ell=1}^L\bar\arrival_\ell(t)$ (see \eqref{elementary_bound_R}) and \eqref{ineq_initial}, and the Markov's inequality. To verify K2a, recall that $K^m(t)=\sum_{\ell=1}^L K^m_\ell$, where $K^m_\ell$ is the service entry counting process for jobs of class $\ell$. Now consider a renewal process $N^m$ with same delay as $K^m_\ell$ (that is, equal to $\min\{t\geq0: K^m_\ell(t)>0\}$), and with renewal times $\tilde \servicereq_{\ell,j}/m$ where $\{\tilde v_{\ell,j}\}$ is an iid sequence   with common distribution $G_{S,\ell}$. Observing that $K^m_\ell$ is a point process whose ``inter-epoch'' times are equal the service requirement of the job a class $\ell$ plus the time until the next job of class $\ell$ enters service (which includes processing times of jobs of other classes and possible server idle times), it follows from a straightforward coupling argument that the modulus of continuity of $K^m_\ell $ is stochastically bounded by that of $N^m$, that is \[P(w'(K^m_\ell,\delta,T)>\eta)\leq P(w'(N^m,\delta,T)>\eta),\] for every $\eta>0$. In addition, defining $\bar N^m(t)=N^m(t)/m$, by the law of large numbers for renewal process (\cite[Theorem 5.10]{CheYao2001}) $\{\bar N^m(t)\}_m$ converges almost surely in $\D$ to $\mu_\ell\id$ as $m\to\infty$. In particular, the sequence $\{\bar N^m\}_m$ is tight and hence, satisfies the condition K2a of Proposition \ref{Kurtz}. Therefore, using the bound established in the last display, $\{\bar K_\ell^m\}_{m\in\N}$ satisfies the condition K2a, and so does $\{\bar K^m\}_{m\in\N}$.

\end{proof}

For every $m\in\N$, $\ell=1,...,L$, and $f\in\fset$ define

\begin{equation}\label{def_Am}
  \bar A^m_\ell(f;t)= \int_{0}^t h_{S,\class^m(u)}\left(m\age^m(u)\right) \frac{\weight_\ell \langle f,\bnu^m_\ell(u)\rangle}{\sum_{\ell'=1}^L\weight_{\ell'}\bql^m_{\ell'}(u)} du.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_Atight}
For every $\ell=1,...,L$ and $f\in\fset$, the sequence $\{\bar A^m_\ell(f;\cdot)\}_{m\in\N}$ is tight in $\D$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We verify the Kurtz criteria of Proposition \ref{Kurtz} for $\{\bar A^m_\ell(f;\cdot)\}$. The first condition K1 trivially holds because $\bar A^m_\ell(f;0)=0$ by definition. To verify K2a, recall from \eqref{Kdcomp_scaled} that
\[
    \bar A^m_\ell(f;t)= \bar\entryC^m_\ell(f;t)-  \bar M^m_{\mathfrak{S},\ell}(f;t).
\]
First, by definition \eqref{def_renegC} of $\entryC^m_\ell$ and \eqref{def_fluid} of fluid-scaled quantities, for $t\in[0,T]$ and $\delta>0$,
\[
|\bar\entryC^m_\ell(f;t+\delta) - \bar\entryC^m_\ell(f;t)| \leq \|f\|(\bar K_\ell^m(t+\delta)-\bar K_\ell^m(t))\leq  \|f\|(\bar K^m(t+\delta)-\bar K^m(t)),
\]
and hence $w'(\bar\entryC^m_\ell(f;\cdot),\delta,T)\leq \|f\| w'(\bar K^m,\delta,T)$.  Since $\{\bar K^m\}$ is tight by Lemma \ref{lem_Ktight}, it satisfies K2a by Proposition \ref{Kurtz}, and hence, so does $\{\bar\entryC^m_\ell(f;\cdot)\}$. Moreover, $\{\bar M^m_{\mathfrak{S},\ell}(f;t)\}$ converges to zero in distribution, and hence is tight and satisfies K2a as well. Therefore, $\{\bar A^m_\ell(f;\cdot)\}$ also satisfies K2a.
