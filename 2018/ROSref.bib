	abstract = {In operations research and networking problems, random-order-of-service (ROS) provides a well-known alternative to the classic first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy. Models with ROS policy are typically harder to analyze than their FCFS counterparts, with some performance measures notoriously hard to obtain. While significant progress has been realized in the analysis of random-order-of-service models with homogeneous customer service demands, the impact of heterogeneous customer demand is largely unknown. The current contribution studies this impact, with a discrete-time random-order-of-service queue serving customers with heterogeneous demands. Customer service times are independent random variables with type-dependent distribution. The numbers of new arrivals in each slot are independent and identically distributed over time, but can be type-correlated within a single slot. This corresponds to bursty input traffic generated by a finite number of sources, with one source for each type. The burstiness consists in correlation among sources (or types): the rate at which a source generates customers depends on the instantaneous rate of all other sources (and vice versa). Using a transform-based approach yields closed-form formulas for the first few moments of the customer waiting time. Facilitator is a multi-stage description of the customer sojourn, which allows establishing a relation between the so-called conditional waiting time and the actual steady-state customer waiting time. A somewhat unexpected result shows that, under certain conditions on the arrival and service processes, the random-order-of-service policy outperforms the first-come-first-served policy in terms of mean waiting time. A number of numerical examples illustrate this finding.},

To describe the evolution of this system, we use a measure valued process that keeps track of the residual service times of all jobs in the system at any given time. From this measure valued process, one can recover the traditional performance processes, including queue length and workload. We show that under mild assumptions, including standard heavy traffic assumptions, the (suitably rescaled) measure valued processes corresponding to a sequence of processor sharing queues converge in distribution to a measure valued diffusion process. The limiting process is characterized as the image under an appropriate lifting map, of a one-dimensional reflected Brownian motion. As an immediate consequence, one obtains a diffusion approximation for the queue length process of a processor sharing queue.},

We provide a direct probabilistic argument to show that the sojourn time under PS is equal (in distribution) to the waiting time under ROS of a customer arriving to a non-empty system. We thus conclude that the sojourn time distribution for PS is related to the waiting-time distribution for ROS through a simple multiplicative factor, which corresponds to the probability of a non-empty system at an arrival instant. We verify that previously derived expressions for the sojourn time distribution in the M/M/1 PS queue and the waiting-time distribution in the M/M/1 ROS queue are indeed identical, up to a multiplicative constant. The probabilistic nature of the argument enables us to extend the equivalence result to more general models, such as the M/M/1/K queue and ·/M/1 nodes in product-form networks.},
